75. Build a PHP function that takes the filename and a new line of content as input. Append the new
line of content as a new line at the end of the file.
code:
<?php
function appendToFile($filename, $newLine) {
    // Open the file in append mode
    $file = fopen($filename, "a");

    if ($file) {
        // Add newline character before appending
        fwrite($file, $newLine . PHP_EOL);
        fclose($file);
        echo "✅ New line added to file successfully.";
    } else {
        echo "❌ Error: Unable to open the file.";
    }
}

// Example usage:
appendToFile("demo.txt", "This is an appended line.");
?>
