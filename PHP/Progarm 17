Examine the various control structures in php and construct a bank transaction problem
with customers deposit and withdrawal of amount.

<?php
$balance = 1000; // initial balance
$transaction = "withdraw"; // deposit or withdraw
$amount = 300;

// if-else control structure
if ($transaction == "deposit") {
    $balance += $amount;
    echo "Deposited ₹$amount. New Balance: ₹$balance";
} elseif ($transaction == "withdraw") {
    // nested if
    if ($amount <= $balance) {
        $balance -= $amount;
        echo "Withdrew ₹$amount. New Balance: ₹$balance";
    } else {
        echo "Insufficient balance!";
    }
} else {
    echo "Invalid transaction type!";
}
?>
output:
