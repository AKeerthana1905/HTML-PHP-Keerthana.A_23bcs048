66. Difference between count() and sizeof() function in PHP.
In PHP, count() and sizeof() are practically the same function â€” sizeof() is just an alias of count().

Hereâ€™s the difference explained clearly:

ðŸ”¹ count()

Returns the number of elements in an array or something Countable (like objects implementing Countable interface).

Commonly used in PHP.

<?php
$fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Mango"];
echo count($fruits); // Output: 3
?>

ðŸ”¹ sizeof()

It does the exact same thing as count().

sizeof() is just an alias of count() for readability purposes.

<?php
$fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Mango"];
echo sizeof($fruits); // Output: 3
?>
