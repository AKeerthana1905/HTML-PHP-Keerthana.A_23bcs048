39. A school wants to automate the calculation of student grades. Design a system that allows teachers to inputstudent scores, calculates their grades, and generates a summary report. How would you utilize arrays and array functions to store and process the student data effectively?
CODE:
<?php
$students = array(
    "Alice" => 85,
    "Bob" => 72,
    "Charlie" => 91,
    "David" => 64,
    "Eve" => 48
);
function getGrade($score) {
    if ($score >= 90) return "A+";
    elseif ($score >= 80) return "A";
    elseif ($score >= 70) return "B";
    elseif ($score >= 60) return "C";
    elseif ($score >= 50) return "D";
    else return "F";
}
$grades = array();

foreach ($students as $name => $score) {
    $grades[$name] = getGrade($score);
}
echo "----- Student Grade Report -----\n";
foreach ($students as $name => $score) {
    echo "$name - Score: $score - Grade: {$grades[$name]}\n";
}
$average = array_sum($students) / count($students);
$highestScore = max($students);
$topStudent = array_search($highestScore, $students);

echo "\nClass Average: " . round($average, 2);
echo "\nTop Student: $topStudent ($highestScore marks)";
?>
OUTPUT:
----- Student Grade Report -----
Alice - Score: 85 - Grade: A
Bob - Score: 72 - Grade: B
Charlie - Score: 91 - Grade: A+
David - Score: 64 - Grade: C
Eve - Score: 48 - Grade: F
Class Average: 72
Top Student: Charlie (91 marks)
