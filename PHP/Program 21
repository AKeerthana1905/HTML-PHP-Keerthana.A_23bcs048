Create a PHP script that counts the number of occurrences of a specific word in a given
string.

<?php
$text = "PHP is great and PHP is easy to learn.";
$word = "php";
$count = 0;
foreach (str_word_count(strtolower($text), 1) as $w) {
    if ($w == strtolower($word)) $count++;
}
echo "Occurrences: $count";
?>
