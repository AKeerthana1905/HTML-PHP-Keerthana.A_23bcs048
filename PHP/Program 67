67. Construct a program that tokenizes a sentence into words using regular expressions. Then, count the
number of occurrences of each word and display the results.
<?php
// Input sentence
$sentence = "PHP is great, and PHP is powerful. PHP is easy to learn!";

// Step 1: Tokenize sentence into words using regex
$words = preg_split("/[\s,!.?]+/", strtolower($sentence), -1, PREG_SPLIT_NO_EMPTY);

// Step 2: Count occurrences of each word
$wordCount = array_count_values($words);

// Step 3: Display results
echo "Word Frequency Count:<br>";
foreach ($wordCount as $word => $count) {
    echo "$word : $count<br>";
}
?>
Output:
Word Frequency Count:
php : 3
is : 3
great : 1
and : 1
powerful : 1
easy : 1
to : 1
learn : 1
