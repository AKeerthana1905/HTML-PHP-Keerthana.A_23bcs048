71. Tell the different file handling modes available in PHP?
<?php
$filename = "demo.txt";

// Writing to a file using 'w' mode
$file = fopen($filename, "w");
fwrite($file, "Hello, this is written using w mode.\n");
fclose($file);

// Reading the file using 'r' mode
$file = fopen($filename, "r");
echo "Reading file using r mode:<br>";
echo fread($file, filesize($filename));
fclose($file);

// Appending to a file using 'a' mode
$file = fopen($filename, "a");
fwrite($file, "This line is appended using a mode.\n");
fclose($file);

// Reading again to see appended content
$file = fopen($filename, "r");
echo "<br>Reading after append:<br>";
echo fread($file, filesize($filename));
fclose($file);
?>
Reading file using r mode:
Hello, this is written using w mode.

Reading after append:
Hello, this is written using w mode.
This line is appended using a mode.
