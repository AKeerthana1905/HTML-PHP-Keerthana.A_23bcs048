93. Write a PHP program that keeps track of how many times a visitor has loaded the page.
<?php
// Check if cookie exists
if(isset($_COOKIE['visit_count'])) {
    $count = $_COOKIE['visit_count'] + 1;
} else {
    $count = 1;
}

// Set (update) cookie for 1 year
setcookie('visit_count', $count, time() + (365*24*60*60));

echo "You have visited this page $count times.";
?>
