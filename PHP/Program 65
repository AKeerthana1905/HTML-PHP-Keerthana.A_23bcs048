65. Demonstrate PHP script that checks if a string contains another string and displays the result.
<?php
// Main string
$text = "Welcome to PHP programming!";

// Word to search
$search = "PHP";

// Check if string contains another
if (strpos($text, $search) !== false) {
    echo "The string '$search' was found in the text.";
} else {
    echo "The string '$search' was NOT found in the text.";
}
?>
Output:
The string 'PHP' was found in the text.
